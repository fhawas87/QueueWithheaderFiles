It is a simple project to practice C++ and some new data structures and algorithms such as priority queue, minheap, maxheap etc.

Also wanted to practice compiling multiple source files with llvm APIs and header files using clang.

It basically use heapify algorithm ( min heap ) to figure out which of given point is closest to start point and set priority in priority queue. Later added some basic program which is calculating convex polygon area of given points. 

And at the end of the program asks if you want to see first x lines of intermediate representation of code.
